# Speedy

Speedy is an utility application for Mac OS X that lets you read the text faster. 

I created to read the emails & news faster, as I have a tendency to lost in  ['endless space between the words'](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/quotes?item=qt2085733) with my lack of concentration or I should say gift of imagination? 

To use the app Speedy, select text you want to speed read and choose Speedy from "Services" menu. You can increase or decrease the speed by using your UP or DOWN arrow keys & SPACE to pause and unpause. 

Peace‚úåüèº
